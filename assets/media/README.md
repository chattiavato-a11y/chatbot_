# Media storage

Use this directory for UI assets such as screenshots, logos, and illustrative pictures.

- Keep filenames descriptive and prefer compressed, web-safe formats (PNG, JPG, or SVG).
- Add alt text descriptions wherever assets are referenced to preserve accessibility.
- Avoid storing secrets or user-generated uploads here; this folder is for static media checked into the repo.
